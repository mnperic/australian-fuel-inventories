# Forecasting Australian Automotive Fuel Inventories
 Using prophet to predict and forecast future Australian automotive fuel sales, imports, production, exports, and inventory levels.

## Overview
The premise of this project was to analyse past Australian automotive fuel sales, imports, production, exports, and inventory levels and create a predictive model to forecast future outlooks.

To conduct this, historical Australian automotive fuel data was obtained for the 2010-2023 period, and future prices were forecasted from 2024-2029.

Note: data for the total 'Inventory' of fuel was not originally provided in dataset. To calculate this variable, cumulative total was calculated, where:

<i>Production</i> for the first datetime (1/07/2010) was calculated as base
<br></br>
<i>Import</i> for the first datetime (1/07/2010) was added
<br></br>
<i>Sale</i> for the first datetime (1/07/2010) was minused, and
<br></br>
<i>Export</i> for the first datetime (1/07/2010) was minused.

## Visualisation
### Forecast
#### Sale

</p>

As illustrated in the chart, although remaining at high levels, the overall trend of Australia's sale of automotive gasoline is declining at a steady rate. This trend may perhaps be due to lessening global reliance on automotive fuel in the form of gasoline, and an ever-growing global appetite for electric vehicles.  

#### Import

 <p align="center">

</p>

As illustrated in the chart, the overall trend of Australia's import of automotive fuel is increasing at a rapid yet consistent rate. This trend may perhaps be due to a weakening of the Australian oil market, and an increase in the nation's production, sale, export, and inventory of renewable energies. Consequently, considering the rapid (yet consistent) trend in the nation's import of automotive gasoline, the chart also illustrates Australia's continued use and reliance of automotive gasoline for domestic use.
<br></br>
Based on historical data and trend, the forecast outlines how Australia's import of automotive gasoline will continue to increase in the near future, with total gasoline imports almost doubling by 2028 as compared to 2020 (less than a decade). 

#### Production

</p>

As illustrated in the chart, although remaining at considerably high levels in 2010, the overall trend of Australia's production of automotive gasoline is declining at a rapid rate. This trend may perhaps also be due to lessening global reliance on automotive fuel in the form of gasoline, and Australia's renewed appetite and industry for other forms of fuel types (i.e., renewable energy). 
<br></br>
Based on historical data and trend, the forecast outlines how Australia's production of automotive gasoline will more or less cease by Q2 2028.

#### Export

 <p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/mnperic/australian-fuel-inventories/blob/main/images/model_export.png" alt="model"/>
</p>

As illustrated in the chart, the overall trend of Australia's export of automotive gasoline is declining at a steady rate. This trend may perhaps also be due to lessening global appetite for gasoline as an automotive fuel, and an increased global desire for automative fuels in the form of reneweable energy (i.e., electric vehicles using electricity generated by solar, wind, hydro power etc.).
<br></br>
Based on historical data and trend, it is interesting to highlight that by 2024, Australia's total export of automotive gasoline will cease, with future exports not bucking this trend.

#### Inventory

 <p align="center">

</p>

As illustrated in the chart, the overall trend of Australia's inventory/stock on hand of automotive gasoline remains at a steady rate. This trend may perhaps be due to the need for the nation to ensure optimal/healthy supply of automotive gasoline for national usage and backup. 
<br></br>
Based on historical data and trend, it is interesting to highlight that although the total inventory of automotive gasoline remains consistent and steady, there is an overall declining trend of automotive gasoline on hand.
